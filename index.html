      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am learning coding and have dabbled in it previously on my own. I made a weeb website to mess around and found it to be something I enjoy. I tend to play video games, watch anime, and keep up to date with some fun-to-watch Twitch streamers. Check out my Twitch at <a href="https://www.onlyfavalot.com">Sir Favalot's Sanctuary</a></p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am an Arizona native and hate every second of the heat. It is nice not having to deal with natural disasters though!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I play survival horror games and mainly grind Rocket League. I did recently download Genshin Impact and am now serving a life sentence to grinding. I like to watch horror and comedy movies/shows. I also have 4 dogs which I play and cuddle with constantly!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I do not know where this knowledge will take me but I wish for it to be everchanging!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In a bunker under Lake Lao Gai... Let me know if you get this reference...</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I often times spend days learning something new and this is a rabbit hole I find myself digging deeper into! I like solving problems and creating so this is absolutely the place to be!</p>
